Analyzing characteristics of successful credit unions using financial data, cloud technologies, and machine learning

Once we define the metrics that reflect success ( % growth in membership, total assets, loan to share ratio, return on average asset, delinquency rates..), we will need to solidify the questions we ask. Some ideas:
